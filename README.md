# Ga-Ngx-Master-Detail-Demo

This project was initially generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.2.

Web Config file was ejected from CLI for further custom manual configuration.

## Prerequisites

The demo project has library dependencies that require Node 6.9.0 or higher, together with NPM 3 or higher in order to install and run the commands listed below. You cannot go further if you do not install these itesm. Please click on this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install Node/NPM before you continue.

## Download and installation

1. Download the Zip file version of this code from this Github repository
2. Extract the contents into a folder on your documents or desktop machine
3. Open a command terminal and navigate to the extracted contents folder directory
4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies for the app
5. To run, follow the instructions below to initiate the development server and other pieces of the application

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Documentation server

Run `npm run compodoc` to generate and run a server that serves documentation files of the app. Navigate to `http://localhost:3003/`to inspect the documentation. The document server will automatically update if any files are updated.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

To see code coverage, run `ng test --code-coverage` and then open the `/coverage/index.html` file

## Running end-to-end tests

### There are no end-to-end tests for this project

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Potential TODOs to continue enhancing the demo application

Due to the Christmas and New Years holidays, I was not able to devote much time to the demo. Most of this demo work was completed in a day. Below is a list of additional TODOs to best enhance the application:

- [ ] Add more information about the repo in main content section
- [ ] Add integration tests for the APIs
- [ ] Add more working unit tests
- [ ] Get at least 70% code test coverage for unit tests
- [ ] Add spinners to denote asynchronous data loads
- [ ] Add icon imagery for representing code language
- [ ] Enhance display of repo information with expansion panels
- [ ] Display message if no coding languages found for repo
- [ ] Display message if no repos found for user
- [ ] New UI component to select different user to display repos
- [ ] Generate helpful messages when client or backend errors occur
- [ ] Implement a logging service for client or backend errors
- [ ] Web analytics
